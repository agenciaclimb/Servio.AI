## Gemini Analysis

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM

### Findings

1. The repository 'agenciaclimb/Servio.AI' has a significant number of commits (382) and branches (38), suggesting active development and potential complexity.
2. The presence of 10 potential secret leaks identified by security scanning warrants investigation and remediation.
3. While hardening efforts and successful secret scanning are noted, the initial 'potential_secret_leak' findings elevate the risk level.
4. The number of contributors (5) indicates a small team, which may impact code review thoroughness.
5. There are 57 source files and 125 test files, the high number of tests is a good sign, although should be reviewed that covers the source code sufficiently.

### Recommendations

1. Immediately investigate and remediate the 10 potential secret leaks identified in the repository. Rotate any exposed secrets and update affected configurations.
2. Implement stricter secret scanning policies and pre-commit hooks to prevent future leaks.
3. Conduct thorough code reviews, especially focusing on areas affected by the potential secret leaks.
4. Consider increasing the number of contributors to enhance code review capacity and expertise.
5. Automate secret detection as a CI/CD pipeline step to ensure that no secrets are committed to the repository.
6. Review current testing practices to ensure the test suite is appropriately testing vulnerable areas
