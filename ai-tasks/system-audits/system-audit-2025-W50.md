## Gemini Analysis

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM

### Findings

1. Identified 10 potential secret leaks in the codebase.
2. The number of branches (38) compared to contributors (5) may indicate a complex branching strategy that could increase the risk of merge conflicts or integration issues.
3. While the number of test files (125) is significant, the effectiveness of these tests needs to be further evaluated to ensure adequate code coverage and quality.

### Recommendations

1. Immediately investigate and remediate the 10 potential secret leaks. Implement secret scanning and management tools to prevent future occurrences.
2. Review the branching strategy to simplify and streamline the development process. Consider adopting a more standardized branching model like Gitflow or GitHub Flow.
3. Perform a code coverage analysis to assess the effectiveness of the existing tests. Write additional tests to cover areas with insufficient coverage.
4. Implement static analysis tools to automatically detect and prevent security vulnerabilities during the development process.
