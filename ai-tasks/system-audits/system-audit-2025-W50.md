## Gemini Analysis

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM

### Findings

1. Potential secret leaks detected in the codebase.
2. High number of commits may indicate frequent changes, requiring careful review.
3. A substantial number of test files relative to source files suggests good testing practices, but the revealed secrets pose a risk.

### Recommendations

1. Immediately revoke and rotate all leaked secrets.
2. Implement a secret scanning solution in the CI/CD pipeline to prevent future leaks.
3. Conduct a thorough security review of the affected code areas.
4. Educate developers on secure coding practices and secret management.
5. Enforce stricter access controls on sensitive files and repositories.
