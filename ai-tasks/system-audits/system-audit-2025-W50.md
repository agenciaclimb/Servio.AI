## Gemini Analysis

**Risk Level**: HIGH

### Findings

1. Potential secret leak detected. API keys are exposed in the codebase.
2. High number of branches may indicate unstable development practices.
3. Potential risk due to a high number of commits.

### Recommendations

1. Immediately revoke and rotate the exposed API keys.
2. Implement a secret management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and access sensitive credentials securely.
3. Enforce stricter branch management policies (e.g., using pull requests and code reviews) to improve code quality and stability.
4. Implement static analysis tools to automatically detect and prevent future secret leaks.
5. Review commit history and remove any accidentally committed secrets.
6. Educate developers on secure coding practices, particularly regarding the handling of sensitive information.
